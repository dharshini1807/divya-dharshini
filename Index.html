<br><b><i><font size =  6px>About this:</font></b></br><font size =  4px><br>This Routine influencer application is a simple and user-friendly webpage designed to help users organize their daily tasks efficiently. It allows users to add, view, and manage their tasks in an easy way, making daily planning more effective</br><br>

This project is my first HTML project and my first webpage, created to understand the basics of web development. Through this project, I learned how to structure a webpage using HTML and gained hands-on experience in building a real, working page from scratch.

Developing this Routine Influencer app helped me improve my confidence and interest in front-end development. It marks the beginning of my journey in web development and motivates me to learn more advanced technologies in the future.</font> </br>
