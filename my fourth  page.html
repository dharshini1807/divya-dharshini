Med Time is created to support a healthy routine by ensuring medicines are taken regularly and on time. It is especially useful for people who have a busy schedule or need timely reminders.

This feature was developed as part of my project to understand how time-based reminders work in web applications. It makes the application more useful and user-friendly by providing timely alerts.</i></ul></p></font>
